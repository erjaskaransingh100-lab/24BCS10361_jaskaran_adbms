# SQL Set Operators Lab

This repository contains SQL experiments demonstrating the implementation of **SQL Set Operators**: `UNION`, `UNION ALL`, `INTERSECT`, and `EXCEPT`.

These experiments were performed as part of a Database Management Systems (DBMS) laboratory exercise to understand how SQL combines and compares data from multiple tables.

\---

## 📚 Topics Covered

* UNION
* UNION ALL
* INTERSECT
* EXCEPT

\---

## 📖 Experiment Overview

### Experiment 2.1 – UNION

Combines records from two tables while removing duplicate rows.

```sql
SELECT \*
FROM Arts
UNION
SELECT \*
FROM Science;
```

\---

### Experiment 2.2 – UNION ALL

Combines records from two tables while preserving duplicate rows.

```sql
SELECT emp\_name
FROM Employee
UNION ALL
SELECT emp\_name
FROM pt\_employee;
```

\---

### Experiment 2.3 – INTERSECT

Returns only the records that are common to both tables.

```sql
SELECT f\_name
FROM fruit
INTERSECT
SELECT inv\_name
FROM inventory;
```

\---

### Experiment 2.4 – EXCEPT

Returns records present in the first table but absent in the second table.

```sql
SELECT f\_name
FROM fruit
EXCEPT
SELECT inv\_name
FROM inventory;
```

## 📌 SQL Set Operators Comparison

|Operator|Removes Duplicates|Purpose|
|-|-|-|
|**UNION**|✅ Yes|Combines unique records from both queries|
|**UNION ALL**|❌ No|Combines all records including duplicates|
|**INTERSECT**|✅ Yes|Returns common records from both queries|
|**EXCEPT**|✅ Yes|Returns records present only in the first query|

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

After completing these experiments, you will be able to:

* Use SQL Set Operators effectively.
* Understand the difference between `UNION` and `UNION ALL`.
* Retrieve common records using `INTERSECT`.
* Find non-matching records using `EXCEPT`.
* Apply Set Operators in real-world database scenarios.
